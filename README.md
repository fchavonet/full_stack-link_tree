# Link Tree

## Description

This project is a custom link page inspired by platforms like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), designed to be used as a QR code landing page on my resume or business card.

It provides a fast and lightweight overview of my profile as a full stack developer, with quick access to my main projects, social media profiles, and contact details. 

Unlike a full portfolio website, this page is optimized for quick scanning and mobile viewing. Think of it as a curated snapshot of my work and skills, designed for recruiters or collaborators who want to get a first impression in just a few seconds.

## Objectives

- Provide a fast-loading, mobile-first web interface.
- Highlight personal projects with preview screenshots.
- Showcase professional profiles and contact links.
- Practice DOM manipulation, scroll events, and animations in vanilla JavaScript.- 
- Animate UI components on load and scroll to enhance user engagement.
